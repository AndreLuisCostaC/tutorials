    "# Bertrand's box paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes even when a logically sound analytical solution is found for a problem skepticism remains. Thus, empirical simulation can be a useful tool to verify results. Bertrand's box paradox is one such example. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three boxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a box containing two gold coins,\n",
    "- a box containing two silver coins,\n",
    "- a box containing one gold coin and a silver coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'paradox' is in the probability, after choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random, if that happens to be a gold coin, of the next coin drawn from the same box also being a gold coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick python script can easily simulate this game thousands of times and get a solid probability for this paradox in expectation. When trying to convince people through simulation it is often wise to be explicit in describing the game to avoid confusion when presenting results."
